# Analysis-of-Network-Centrality-Measures-in-Python
Within this work, several experiments in Oldham et al. [1] paper that is conducted in MATLAB, are coded up using Jupyter Notebook.

As networks, it is simulated 40 networks: 20 unconstrainted weighted using Erdos-Renyi [2] generative model and 20 constrained unweighted using Maslov-Sneppen [3] algorithm.
After the brief information about Erdos-Renyi and Maslov-Sneppen models, 15 centrality measures are introduced and the correlation between them are discussed.
Assortativity and Connection Density of networks are revealed, as well. 

Please note that this work is done as an assignment of Graph Theory course (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLug43ldmRSo3MV-Jgjr30E5SpwNKkjTvJ) Fall 2020, in Istanbul Technical University.
